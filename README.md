# Measuring the Persuasiveness of an Arbitrary Email

This repository introduces the persuasiveness metric.

- The persuasiveness metric is concluded from a systematic literature review on [persuasive natural language processing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05786). It quantitatively determines the persuasiveness of any given email.
- This persuasiveness metric scores a message through a comparison to 20.000 successful messages. These were extracted, scored and compiled from the ([GMANE](webis.de)) email dataset. It consists of 160 million emails. 
- Additionally, this persuasvieness-metric provides a word level analysis of the text, and gives descriptive indices of the input email. These indices are inspired by the Text Complexity Analyzer implementation by [Hans](https://github.com/Hans03430/TextComplexityAnalyzerCM).
- This object oriented project is based on [SpaCy v3](http://spacy.io/), and can be deployed as a FastAPI microservice on Google Cloud Run.
